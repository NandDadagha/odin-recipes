    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Make the brownies: Cream butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer.
            Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl.
            Add flour mixture to butter mixture and mix until batter is smooth. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes.
            Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the frosting: Combine butter, cocoa powder, and milk in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until smooth.
            Gradually add powdered sugar and mix until frosting is smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Spoon frosting in a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #10 tip. Pipe a circle of frosting near the bottom half of each mini brownie to create the turkey's head.
            Add two candy eyes. Add 1 red chocolate piece to form the beak. Pipe 5 lines of frosting in the shape of a semi-circle formation coming up from the head.
            Place a piece of candy corn on each of the 5 lines to form the turkey's feathers.</li>
    </ol>
